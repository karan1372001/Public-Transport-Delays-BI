# Public Transport Delays – Big Data & Business Intelligence

This project was developed as part of the **Big Data and Business Intelligence** module during my **MSc Computer Science** at **Teesside University**.

## Project Overview
Public transport delays negatively impact passenger satisfaction and operational efficiency.  
This project analyses public transport delay data to identify key factors influencing service reliability.

The analysis focuses on:
- Peak vs off-peak hours
- Traffic congestion levels
- Weather conditions
- Transport modes (Bus, Metro, Train, Tram)

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Power BI
- Power Query (ETL)
- CSV Dataset
- Business Intelligence & Data Visualisation

## Data Processing
- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- Feature engineering (Peak hour indicators, delay categorisation)
- Data normalisation for consistent analysis

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive filters and slicers
- KPI cards (Total Trips Analysed, Total Delayed Trips)
- Delay analysis by:
  - Transport mode
  - Weather conditions
  - Traffic congestion
  - Peak hours

## Key Insights
- Delays are significantly higher during peak hours
- Higher traffic congestion leads to increased delays
- Bus and Train services experience the most delays
- Adverse weather conditions increase service disruption
